# Optimizing Python Performance: Parallelism & Async 🐍💨

Python is powerful, but single-threaded execution can be a bottleneck in CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks. To optimize performance, we can leverage parallelism (multiprocessing) and asynchronous programming (asyncio).

⚡ When to Use What?
- Multiprocessing → Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., data processing, ML training).
- Asyncio & Threading → Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., API calls, file I/O, database queries).

💡 Key Takeaways
- Use multiprocessing for CPU-heavy tasks (parallel execution).
- Use asyncio for I/O-heavy tasks (non-blocking execution).
- Avoid Python’s GIL limitations with multiprocessing when dealing with CPU-bound workloads.

Optimizing Python is all about choosing the right approach based on your workload!
